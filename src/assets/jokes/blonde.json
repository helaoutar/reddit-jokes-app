 {"content" : "The leader says, \"We are all here today to prove to the world that blondes are not stupid. Can I have a volunteer?\"\r\n\r\nA blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.\r\n\r\nThe leader asks her, \"What is 15 plus 15?\"\r\n\r\nAfter 15 or 20 seconds she says, \"Eighteen!\"\r\n\r\nObviously everyone is a little disappointed. Then 80,000 blondes start cheering, \"Give her another chance! Give her another chance!\"\r\n\r\nThe leader says, \"Well since we\'ve gone to the trouble of getting 80,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, I guess we can give her another chance.\"\r\n\r\nSo he asks, \"What is 5 plus 5?\"\r\n\r\nAfter nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, \"Ninety?\"\r\n\r\nThe leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 girls begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, \"GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE! GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE!\"\r\n\r\nThe leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, \"Ok! Ok! Just one more chance -- What is 2 plus 2?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, \"Four?\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 80,000 girls jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... \"Give her another chance! Give her another chance!\""}
